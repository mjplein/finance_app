# finance_app

Emerald is a finance budgeting app.  


We created 5 models, 2 of which have yet to be implemented.  The primary model is the User.  It takes in a User Name, a Password, and an Email.  The functional models include Budget (an initial balance), Expenses (type--withdrawal/deposit; description--such as food, transportation, rent, etc.; value--however much was spent or deposited).

A lot of testing was done in Postman and a test.html.  Our API routes all function as they should, but the ajax was not completed yet.
